# Methodology
##Sentiment analysis, an important area in Natural Language Processing, is the process of automatically detecting affective states of text. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice-of-customer materials such as product reviews in online shopping websites like Amazon, movie reviews or social media. It can be just a basic task of classifying the polarity of a text as being positive/negative or it can go beyond polarity, looking at sentiment states etc.

# Novelty
#### • VADER is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.
#### • VADER is intelligent enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as "did not love" as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as "ENJOY".
#### •It can be directly applied to labeled or unlabeled data and it comes with the nltk package.
